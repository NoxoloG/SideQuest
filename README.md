## 🌍 Inspiration

I built this project to solve my own problem: struggling to stay motivated and finish daily tasks. I asked myself,  
> *“What if productivity felt like a game?”*  

With zero prior coding experience, I challenged myself to turn this idea into reality, and had a blast learning along the way.

## 🧙‍♀️ My Hackathon Journey

I started this with no app development experience. Editing the app took 2 weeks. The video took 3 days. Deployment and domain setup took another full week.  
> This was *fun, eye-opening,* and just the beginning.  

I'm now planning to launch SideQuest publicly and develop additional AI-powered tools to address everyday challenges.
