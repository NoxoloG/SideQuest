- 🔗 Fully deployed with SSL + custom domain

## 🌍 Inspiration

I built this project to solve my own problem: struggling to stay motivated and finish daily tasks. I asked myself,  
> *“What if productivity felt like a game?”*  

With zero prior coding experience, I challenged myself to turn this idea into reality, and had a blast learning along the way.

## 🧙‍♀️ My Hackathon Journey

I started this with no app development experience. Editing the app took 2 weeks. The video took 3 days. Deployment and domain setup took another full week.  
> This was *fun, eye-opening,* and just the beginning.  

I'm now planning to launch SideQuest publicly and develop additional AI-powered tools to address everyday challenges.

> ⚔️ *Level up your life. One side quest at a time.*

Absolutely, Noxolo — here’s a polished, judge-friendly paragraph you can paste into your **Devpost submission**, **README**, or **video description**:

---

### ✅ Note to the judges about my bolt.new URL error they might encounter

> ⚠️ **Note about Bolt.new access:**
> This project was originally built using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), which is a browser-based IDE. However, Bolt does **not share environment variables like `SUPABASE_URL` or `SUPABASE_KEY` across accounts**, which means the app may show an error like **"supabaseUrl is required"** when judges or users try to open it from a different account.
>
> 🛠️ I attempted to hardcode the Supabase credentials inside the Bolt project, but due to Bolt's automatic resets and environment management, the changes get **overwritten after saving**. This caused a major technical limitation I couldn't bypass in time.
>
> ✅ To ensure you can still view and test the full working version of the app, I deployed it live on Netlify here:
> **🔗 [https://sidequest.boltbreaker.site](https://sidequest.boltbreaker.site)**
>
> This version includes:
>
> * Fully functional Supabase integration
> * Working subscriptions
> * Progression features
> * All UI and logic exactly as intended
>
> Thank you for understanding — I wanted to preserve the Bolt project as proof of origin, while still ensuring a smooth judging experience.
